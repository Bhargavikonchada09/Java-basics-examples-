Introduction
Before diving into the concept of operators in Java, it’s essential to practice with simple problem-solving examples. In this blog, we’ll cover basic yet practical problems that will strengthen your understanding of Java’s syntax and logic-building skills.


1. Adding Two Numbers

public class AddTwoNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 55;
        int num2 = 5;
        int sum = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}

This program takes two numbers, adds them, and displays the result.

You can easily modify this code to perform subtraction, multiplication, or division.


Explanation:
We declared two variables num1 and num2 to store the numbers and a third variable sum to store their result after addition. The output is displayed using the System.out.println method.



2. Checking Even or Odd

public class EvenOrOdd {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 67;
        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(number + " is even.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(number + " is odd.");
        }
    }
}

This program checks whether a number is even or odd using the modulus operator (%).

The logic: If the number is completely divisible by 2 (remainder = 0), it’s even; otherwise, it’s odd.


Explanation:
We declared a variable number with a value of 67. The condition number % 2 == 0 checks divisibility. Based on the result, the program outputs whether the number is even or odd.

3. Factorial of a Number

public class Factorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 3;
        int factorial = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
            factorial = factorial * i;
        }
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is: " + factorial);
    }
}

This program calculates the factorial of a number using a for loop.

The factorial of a number (n) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.


Explanation:
The for loop runs from 1 to number (inclusive). In each iteration, the factorial variable is multiplied by i. For example:

1. factorial = 1 * 1 = 1


2. factorial = 1 * 2 = 2


3. factorial = 2 * 3 = 6



The result is printed after the loop ends.
